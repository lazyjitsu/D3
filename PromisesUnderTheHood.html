  //A promise is a property on a deffered object which contains a property called, 'promise.'
  //Now the promise and deffered objects are two seperate javascript objects. As two seperate objects, you can operate on ea. of them independently.
  //Note you can always get to the Promise
  //object from the deferred object by accessing deferred.promise
  //By default, when you first create a promise you have two properties:
  //status which is equsl to pending and value which is undefined by default
  //lets look around....
  var deferred = Promise.defer();
  document.writeln(deferred); //prints undefined
  console.log(deferred); //prints Object {promise: Promise}
  var promise = deferred.promise;
  console.log(promise); //prints Promise {[[ProomiseSttatus]]: "pending", [[PromiseValoue]]: undefined)}
//just to reiterate, that promise object is exactly the same as --- the property,promise on the deferred object!!
//IOW: promise === deferred.Promise
