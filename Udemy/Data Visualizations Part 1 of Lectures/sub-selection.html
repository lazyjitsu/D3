This example demonstrates two very different sub selection techniques.
We will discuss them separately here so you can understand their pros and cons as well as when to use
one versus the other selector level 3 combinators unlike a D-3 select is used with a special looking string
which consists of one tag name connected with another one using a greater than sign open bracket (U + 003E) be greater then close bracket.

This syntax is called combinators The greater than sign here indicates it is a child Combinator level
3 selector supports a few different kinds of structural combinators.
Here we will give a quick introduction to the most common ones the descendant Combinator.
This Combinator has the syntax just like selector selector the descendant Combinator as suggested by
its name is used to describe a loose parent child relationship between two selections.
The reason why it is called a loose parent child relationship is that the descendant combinatory does
not care if the second selection is a child or a grandchild or a great grandchild of the parent selection.
Let's take a look at some examples to illustrate this loose relationship concept.
If we use this selector
it will select the E-M elements since d IB is the ancestor of the E-M element and e m as the descendant
of the development child Combinator.
This Combinator has the syntax such as selector greater than selector
the child Combinator offers a more restrictive way to describe a parent child relationship between two
elements a child Combinator is defined using a greater than sign you plus 0 0 3 be greater than character
separating the two selectors as this it will select the E-M element.
Since E-M is a direct child of the span element in our example the selector divi greater than E M will
not produce any valid selection since M is not a direct child of the DV element.
The level 3 selector also supports sibling commentator's.
However since it is less common we will not cover it here.
You guys can refer to the W3 see Level 3 selector documentation at W3 dot org.
The W3 sea level for selector offers some interesting additional combinators that is following sibling
and reference combinators that can yield some very powerful target selection capability at draps dot
c as SWG Org the D-3 nested sub selection on lines B and C.
A different kind of sub selection technique was used in this case.
A simple D-3 selection was made first on line B by selecting the section hash section to Element immediately
afterward.
Another select was changed to select a DV element.
On-Line see this kind of nested selection defines a scoped selection in plain English.
This basically means to select a DV element that is nested under hash.
Section 2 in semantics.
This is essentially the same as using a descendant Combinator hash.
S. to dvh.
However the advantage of this form of sub selection is that since the parent element is separately selected
it allows you to handle the parent element before selecting the child element.
To demonstrate this let's take a look at this code snippet.
As shown in the code snippet you can see that before we select the DV element we can apply a modifier
function to a hash.
S. to online be one.
This flexibility will be further explored in the next section.
Amazing.
So that's all about this video.
We've looked at performing sub selection in this video in the next video will see function changing. -->
