High this video is about function changing.
Previously we looked at performing sub selection in this video.
We will take a look at how the entire body structure of the code could be constructed using D-3 alone.
D-3 API is completely designed around the idea of function chaining.
Therefore it forms a DSL for building HCM.
SVGA elements dynamically if DSL is a new concept for you I highly recommend checking out this excellent
explanation on dsl by Martin Fowler from his book domain specific languages which can be found at this
link.
Open your local copy of the file in your web browser.
Take a look at how a function change can be used to produce concise and readable code that produces
dynamic visual content
this code generates the visual output similar to what we saw in the previous section despite the visual
similarity to the previous example.
The construction process of the DOMA elements is significantly different in this example as demonstrated
by the code example.
There is no static HCM l element on the page.
Contrary to the previous video where both the section and DV elements existed let's examine closely
how these elements were dynamically created online.
A a general selection was made to the top level body element the body selection result was cached using
a local variable called body then at line b a new element S. was appended to the body.
Remember that the append function returns a new selection that contains the newly appended element.
Therefore online see the id attribute can then be set on a newly created section element to Section
1 afterward On-Line D.
A new DV element was created and appended to hash.
Section 1 with its CSSA class set to blue box on line e..
For the next step similar to the previous line on line f a paragraph element was appended to the DV
element with its textual content set to dynamic blue box On-Line g as illustrated by this example.
This chaining process can continue to create any structure of arbitrary complexity.
In fact this is how a typical D-3 based data visualisation structure is created.
Many visualization projects simply contain only an HVM skeleton and rely on D-3 to create the rest.
Getting comfortable with this way of function chaining is critical.
If you want to become efficient with the D-3 library cool.
That's all for now.
In this video we've looked at function chaining.
Next up will see manipulating the raw selection. -->
