We will see how to get access to raw deal DOMA elements and we'll also take a look at internal structure
of a D-3 Selection object.
Open your local copy of the file in your web browser.
Of course you can achieve this using the EMF child selector or the selection iterator function each
but there are cases where these options are just too cumbersome and inconvenient.
This is when you might find dealing with the raw selection array a more convenient approach.
In this example we'll see how the raw selection array could be accessed and leveraged
this code generates a tabular visual output like this.
In this example we went through an existing HVM l table to color the table.
This is not intended to be a good example of how you would color odd versus even rows in a table using
D-3 instead.
This example is designed to show how raw selection array can be accessed
online.
A We select all rows and store the selection in the selection variable D-3 selection has a convenient
Noad function that returns an array containing the selected element nodes.
Thus in order to access the first selected element you will need to use D-3 dot select all dot nodes.
Open bracket zero close bracket.
The second element can be accessed with D-3 dot select all nodes 1 and so on as we can see on Line B.
The table header element can be accessed using TR selection.
Nodes.
Open bracket 0 close bracket and this will return a DRM element object.
Again as we've demonstrated in previous sections any DOMA element can then be selected directly using
D-3 select as shown inline See Line D E and F..
Demonstrate how each element in selection can be directly indexed and accessed.
Raw selection access could be handy in some cases especially when you need to use D-3 in partnership
with other javascript libraries since other libraries won't be able to work with D-3 selection but only
with raw deal m elements.
What's that CTX dot response dot location line for.
Splendid.
That brings us to the end of this section.
In this video we learned manipulating raw selection summing up the section.
We started off with introducing selection selecting single element and multiple elements.
Then we iterate it through a selection and performed some selection.
Later we saw a function changing and manipulated raw selection in the next section we'll see.
Dealing with data. -->
