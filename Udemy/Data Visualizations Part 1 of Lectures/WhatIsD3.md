You guys we're starting with the brand new section getting started with D-3 in this section we will
slowly introduce you to D-3 and create our first simple visualization.
We'll do this by exploring these topics.
Let's start with the first video.
What is the three in this video.
We're going to take a look at introduction to D-3 and basic visualizations.
The best description of what the story is can be found by looking at the Web sites.
These three day s dot org.
This quote sums up pretty well what D-3 does.
It's a javascript library for manipulating documents based on data.
Basically it brings data to life using hate DML as ve G and C Ss combining powerful visualization components
and a data driven approach with these three.
You get a set of libraries which can be used to easily create visualizations using web standards especially
SVGA.
This means that the visualisations created with the three will run on all modern browsers and most of
the mobile browsers a bit added advantage of using D-3 instead of other frameworks is that it allows
you to easily bind data to the elements you see on the screen.
This allows you to create visualizations that respond to changes in the data.
This approach makes creating animations interactive element much easier.
An alternative approach is a very nice example can be seen at this link this figure shows the unemployment
rate in 2008 in the U.S. you can make a large range of different visualizations with these three to
get a good idea of what DS3 is capable of.
Check out the D-3 gallery at this link.
Which has a large number of impressive examples.
So this was an overview of what the three years and the next video will set up the local web server.
